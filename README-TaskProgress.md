# CalculatorTest

So, this is partially completed.  

Visual Studio  
    1. Create an empty solution called CalculatorTest. - Complete  
    2. Create a class library containing the interface above. - Complete  
    3. Create a C# class to realize the interface as a C# class. - Complete  
    
    
TDD  
    4. Create a class library containing a suite of unit tests for the interface using test-driven design principles. - Complete  
    
    
C#  
    5. Add a diagnostics interface to the calculator class to allow each method to report its calculation results to the debugger. - Complete  
    6. Mock the diagnostics interface and use it to refactor the unit tests so that the test suite checks that the diagnostics interface is called with expected values. - Complete  
    
    
SQL Server  
    7. Create a basic database - Complete  
    7a. and update the application to include a new implementation of the Diagnostics interface which will write the diagnostics information to the database. - Incomplete  
    
    
Web   
    8. Create a simple web service that provides access to a calculator implementation via a REST API using HTTP. - Partially complete  
    9. Create a Web App to invoke the Calculator Web Service (extra points for using Angular) - Partially Complete  
    10. (Optional) Create a new calculator method called GetPrimeNumber which will accept an integer   
    to denote which prime number to return (assuming prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13.. passing in 4 would return the 4th prime number which is 7). - Incomplete
